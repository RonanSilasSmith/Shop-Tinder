## Installation
Pull the project from the repo at https://github.com/RonanSilasSmith/Shop-Tinder to and run NPM start to run it locally. After that you should be able to run it and edit it as you please.

## Usage
To use the application you can go to the deployed link at https://shop-tinder.herokuapp.com/ or alternatively, you could pull from the repo and run it with the instructions above. After you have the application running, you should go and create an account(or you can log in if you've been here before!)
After creating an account or logging in, you should be brought to the home page, and be presented with a product. There are buttons to accept or pass on the product, but you can also swipe right to add them to your cart, or left to see a different product.
After you swipe right, that item should be in your cart, and you can purchase it from there using the paypal API.
